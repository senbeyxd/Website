## What is this page?

This is just my personal website I've coded using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Controls

New video: "n"
Repeat video: "r"
Restart video: "s"
Mute/unmute video: "m"
Pause video: spacebar
Change volume: up and down arrow keys + scrolling on the mute/unmute icon

## Info

Audio autoplay after a redirect currently only works on Chromium-based browsers, as it doesn't work in Firefox and I'm too lazy to test it in other browsers.
